The product allows investor to have exposure to underlying asset without paying the full price of holding the asset. Which of the following answers are considered correct?","是带有杠杆的金融衍生品, 可以放大收益和亏损，有被回收的风险":"The CBBC is a leveraged financial derivative instrument, which can amplify profit well as loss. The CBBC will be called when the price of underlying asset reaches to the predetermined level.","操作方式简单, 跟现货买卖类似":"The CBBC is easy to trade, you can trade it like buy and sell an asset at spot market.","价格跟踪某种标的指数价格, 标的上涨, 牛证上涨, 熊证下跌, 标的下跌, 牛证下跌, 熊证上涨":"The CBBC tracks the value of the underlying asset. When price of the underlying asset rises, the bull contract rises while the bear contract falls; when price of the underlying asset falls, the bull contract falls while the bear contract rises.","牛熊证的定价模型相比期权简单清晰, 价格涨幅与对标资产价格几乎是线性相关":"The theoretical price of CBBC is the difference between strike price and underlying asset price, plus funding cost. The funding cost changes over time.","看涨买牛证,看跌买熊证, 行使价是牛熊证定价的要素,而且是作为判断杠杆的重要依据, 一般来说:":"If you are bullish on the prospect of an underlying asset, you can buy bull contract; if you are bearish on prospect of an underlying asset, buy the bear contract. The strike price is an element in the CBBC pricing, which is also a basis to determine the leverage. In general,","行使价离现货价格越远, 牛熊证价格越低, 杠杆越大":"The further the strike price is from the underlying asset price, the lower a CBBC price is. And the gearing tends to be higher.","行使价离现货价格越远, 牛熊证价格越高, 杠杆越小":"The further the strike price is from the the underlying asset price, the higher the price of CBBC is. And the gearing tends to be lower.","牛熊证有提前收回机制,收回价可以用来度量风险, 触发收回相当于提前止损":"The bull/bear contract can be called before expiry. The call level can be considered as a stop-loss.","现货价格越贴近收回价, 越容易触发收回, 收回后不可再交易":"The closer the underlying asset price is to the call level, the more likely the contract will be called. Trading of the CBBC is terminated immediately upon it is called.","现货价格越偏离收回价, 越容易触发收回, 收回后仍然可以继续交易":"The further the spot price is from the call level, the more likely the contract will be called. Trading can be continued after being called.","牛熊证是一种自带杠杆的结构性产品, 享有杠杆带来的放大收益同时自然需要支付使用杠杆的利息:":"The CBBC is a leveraged, structured produce. It involves a funding cost:","与永续合约一样, 需每日定时收取或者支付资金费用":"Like in perpetual contract, investor should pay or receive funding cost every day at scheduled time.","牛熊证的定价里已经包含了财务费用, 不需要额外支付其他费用":"The CBBC has included the financing cost into its price. No extra funding cost need to be paid.","触发收回后, 会有一段时间的观察期, 观察期之后会进行结算, 假设用户持有标的为BTC_USDT的牛证, 行使价9000 USDT, 收回价10000 USDT:":"In the mandatory call event, the CBBC will be settled after an observation period. Assume a user holds a bull contract of BTC_USDT, strike price 9000 USDT, call level l10000 USDT, then:","如果观察期内最低价低于行使价9000 USDT, 剩余价值为0, 用户不会获得回赠":"If the lowest price observed during the observation period is lower than the strike price (9000 USDT), the residual value is zero. The user will not receive any residual value.","如果观察期内最低价为9500 USDT, 未触及行使价, 用户仍然不会获得剩余价值回赠":"If the lowest price observed during the observation period is 9500 USDT, which isn’t hit the strike price. The user will not receive any residual value.","若未触发收回, 最后交易日(一般为北京时间16:00)之后会停止交易,进行结算, 假设用户持有标的为BTC_USDT的熊证, 行使价12000 USDT, 收回价11000 USDT, 结算价格将使用:":"If the CBBC is held until maturity, the CBBC contract will be terminated and settled. Assume a user holds a CBBC BTC_USDT, strike price 12000 USDT, call level 11000 USDT, then when the CBBC settles at expiry, the settlement price will use","最后交易前一段时间内的标的指数多次采样平均价格10150 USDT(具体采样时长和周期由可查看牛熊证详情)":"the average price captured over a certain period of time before the end of the last trading time, that is 10150 USDT in this example.","最后交易时刻的标的指数实时最新价格10232 USDT":"The last traded price of the underlying asset index at the end of the last trading time, that is 10232 USDT in this example.","$0$ 在 $1$ 已完成结算":"$0$ was settled at $1$","$0$ 在 $1$ 已触发强制回收":"$0$ was called at $1$","$0$ 在 $1$ 已完成结算，您的仓位 $2$ 张总剩余价值 $3$ 已结算至账户余额，请至平仓记录查看":"$0$ was settled at $1$.

This is a new trend in decentralized finance (DeFi), that enables investors to earn maximum returns on their digital assets. Liquidity mining is open to everyone and is the core of decentralized financial models. In a nutshell, this means that you can be generously rewarded by simply staking your cryptocurrency.","流动性代币（liquidity providing token， 也叫LP token）是指流动性提供者往流动池中投入并锁定资金后产生的代币。在一个流动池中，投入资金越多的用户，其流动性代币占有的份额就越高。同时，LP token还是流动池中资产的数学证明，参与者必须持有LP token才能回收自己的池中资产。":"Liquidity tokens (liquidity providing token, also known as LP token), refer to the tokens generated after liquidity providers invest and stake into a Liquidity Pool. In a Liquidity Pool, the more money users invest, the higher their share of liquidity tokens will be. At the same time, LP token is also a mathematical proof of the assets in the current pool and participants must hold LP tokens in order to recover their staked assets in the pool.","我的主页详情链接已复制成功":"Link to My Home was successfully copied","添加流动性":"Add Liquidity","拉黑":"Block","充值入库":"Deposit","扫码获得充值地址":"Scan the QR code to get the deposit address","请通过客户端或在线钱包将您需要充值的NFT资产发送到该地址":"Please send your NFT asset from your wallet to this address.","2.发送完成后，系统会自动确认后将NFT资产充值到您在本站<a class='nftred' href='/nft/explore?entry=Home'>NFT交易-我的资产</a>":"2.We will credit your NFT asset to your <a class=\"nftred\" href=\"/nft?entry=Home\">NFT Assets - NFT Markets</a>, once the transaction is confirmed.","同一个地址可多次充值，不影响到账":"The deposit address can be reused.","对应地址":"Corresponding Address","出库":"Output","入库":"Input","提现出库":"Withdraw From Gallery","请输入提现地址":"Enter recipient address","在上面的输入框中，输入您要提现的钱包地址在确认填写无误后，点击“确认提现出库”按钮提交。您的申请将立即或者几小时内被处理":"Enter the correct recipient address in the above box and click “Confirm to Withdraw” button after double check.

In terms of lending principles, crypto lending is similar to traditional banks lending in that users deposit money into a bank or liquidity pool and then lend money to borrowers. When assets are deposited into Gate.io’s Lending & Mining, their lending pools will be generated. When users redeem their assets, they will receive interest repaid by borrowers in addition to the principal. The interest rate on deposited coins and borrowed coins will vary according to the supply and demand of these currencies.","借贷挖矿的收益从哪里来?":"What’s the source of revenues?","用户添加到借贷挖矿币种池中的流动性，将由系统汇总并借出给借款人。借款人所支付的借款利息，将按流动性占比成为存款方的收益。":"The liquidity added by users (depositor) to the lending pool will be aggregated by the system and lent to the borrower. The interest paid by the borrower will become the revenue of the depositor in proportion to the liquidity share.","添加流动性有什么要求吗?":"Are there any requirements for adding liquidity?","对于每一币种池，添加流动性都有各自的最小数量限制。具体要求请在借贷挖矿币种池界面点击【增加流动性】查看。":"There is different minimum liquidity to be added in different lending pools.

Crowdloan allows a project to crowdsource DOT (for Polkadot slots) or KSM (for Kusama slots) to bootstrap its parachain auction. Candle auction is used to decide the winning projects in auctions. If a project loses in bidding, the DOT or KSM stake will be returned; if a project wins, the DOT or KSM will be locked until the end of its leasing period.
